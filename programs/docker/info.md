+ `COPY` adds files from your Docker clientâ€™s current directory.
+ `ADD` adds tar file exctraction and remote address functionality to `COPY`...
+ `RUN` specifies q command to run within the container
+ `CMD` can be called only once (if ignored only the last line with `CMD` will be executed) specifies what command to run within the container
