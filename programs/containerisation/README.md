A container is an environment started from an image.
An image is built by executing a containerfile.

```mermaid

direction LR
    state containerfile
    state image
    state registry {
        rimage
    }
    state container {
        stopped --> running : start
        running --> stopped : stop
    }

    containerfile --> image : create 
    rimage --> image : pull
    container --> image : commit

    image --> running : run
    image --> rimage : push
```


## containerfile

Each instruction creates one layer:
+ `FROM` creates a layer from a Docker image.
+ `COPY` adds files from your Docker clientâ€™s current directory.
+ `ADD` adds tar file exctraction and remote address functionality to `COPY`...
+ `RUN` specifies q command to run within the container
+ `CMD` can be called only once (if ignored only the last line with `CMD` will be executed) specifies what command to run within the container

shortest container image file could be
```
FROM ubuntu:latest
```
