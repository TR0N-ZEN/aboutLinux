Package managers manage software.  
Considering software can be dependent on other software,  
a manager for this comes in useful since dependencies can grow complicated.  
So software is organized in packages.  
Packages are stored in a repository.  
So if one wants to install a package with a package manager,  
one needs to add sources from where packages can be downloaded,  
these sources are called repositories.  

Packages are specific to package managers,  
there is a program called `alien` to translate pacakges between `.deb` and `.rpm` for example.
