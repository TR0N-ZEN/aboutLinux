# keep a space after [ and a space before ]
# on some occasions (I will insert one here if I don't forget) it is necessary to write [[  ]] instead of [  ], I think if you use the logical and && like [[  && ]]
# either write if [  ] and then in one line and separate them with a scemicolon or write them on different lines
